MySQL    Exercise 2         

1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for example, between 1 and 10).          
----
create table Emp(EmpNO int(4), Ename varchar(15), Sal int(4), DeptNo int (4));
--insert into Emp values(1,'A',5000,1);
--insert into Emp values(1,'A',5000,1);
--insert into Emp values(3,'C',7000,1);
--insert into Emp values(4,'D',9000,2);
--insert into Emp values(5,'E',8000,2);

delimiter //
create procedure check_number()
begin
   declare x int(10);
   set x=9;
   if x < 10 and x > 1  then
      insert into Equation values(x,"between range");
   elseif x < 10 then
      insert into Equation values(x," not between range");
   else
      insert into Equation values(x,"Higher range");
   end if;
End;//
delimiter ;

2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and determine whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must always be greater than the third side.         


 3. Check if a given a year is a leap year. The condition is:- year should be (divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100) or (divisible by 4 and divisible by 400.). The year should be Selected from some table.        
delimiter  //
create procedure Check_year(yr int(10))
Begin
    declare y int(10);
    set y=yr;
    if MOD(y,4)=0 and MOD(y,100)!=0  or MOD(y,400)=0 then
         insert into Equation values(y,"Leap Year");
    else
         insert into Equation values(y,"Not a Leap Year");
    end if;
End;//
delimiter ;

4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings.  Your program should then determine if one character string exists inside another character string.     

delimiter //
create procedure()
Begin
   declare year
End;//
